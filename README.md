# 👾 Taridoku (gh0xt) - **Web3 Security Researcher & Solidity Auditor**

---

## 🧑‍💻 About Me  
I’m a **Web3 Security Researcher & Solidity Auditor**, focused on uncovering vulnerabilities in smart contracts and DeFi protocols. I actively participate in **audit contests** on platforms like Sherlock & Cantina.

My approach combines:  
- **Manual review** of protocol logic & invariants  
- **Fuzzing & invariant testing** with Foundry  
- **Economic & design-level analysis** of protocols
